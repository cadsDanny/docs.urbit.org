A **term** is an {% tooltip label="atom" href="/glossary/atom" /%} with an {%
tooltip label="aura" href="/glossary/aura" /%} of `@tas`. It's for strings, but
with a highly-restricted character set: lower-case letters, numbers, and the
hyphen symbol. Additionally, the first character must be a letter. It's used
mostly for naming and tagging.

Note that the aura alone doesn't restrict the characters, and if necessary
should be enforced with {% tooltip label="++sane"
href="/language/hoon/reference/stdlib/4b#sane" /%} and {% tooltip
label="++sand" href="/language/hoon/reference/stdlib/4b#sand" /%}.
